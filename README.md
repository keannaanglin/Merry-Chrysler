# Merry-Chrysler
Final Project by KeAnna Anglin, Tommy Bennett, and Breelyn Betts

Description of Project: 
Our project is a Christmas themed chaser game in which users have to prevent Santa Claus from being attacked by evil gingerbread. The longer Santa Claus stays alive, the more gingerbread appear at random speeds so that the game becomes more challenging as you progress. Each time Santa Claus is attacked by a gingerbread the progress/health bar will decrease. At the top of the page, users can see their overall score.
